## What are your experiences with the Star Fox Franchise?
I grew up with the Nintendo GameCube being my first console. I only had about 13 games on there (that I still have) and to start off one of them was Star Fox Adventures. I vividly remember someone I know needing to use a spoon to complete the Test of Strength. As for me playing, I didn't read text as a kid so I never got past the part where you had to get the mushrooms to heal Tricky's mom. Many years later I played and beat the game and it was nice, although I don't remember much of the game outside of some setpiece moments and the annoying Test of Fear. <br />
Another game on the Gamecube I had was Star Fox Assault. While I don't remember much of my inital opinions of the game, I'm pretty sure I liked the game a lot. This was also my first shooter so I haven't played one where aiming was actually well done. On top of that being able to enter/exit vehicles was something I always found cool as it was the first game I played to do that. I even ended up getting the gold medal's on all the missions much later after a long struggle. <br />
Fast forward to much later and I got a 3Ds and got Star Fox 64 3D as one of the three games I bought with it. As a kid I generally wasn't a fan of the on-rails Arwing levels and because Star Fox 64 is literally only that I disliked it a lot more than Star Fox Assault. Despite that I still played it quite a bit. I don't remember much from the game other than learning that titling the Arwing is really good after losing a wing on the Andross true form fight. <br />

Keep in mind that I shared this game with others, and while I did play it the most, some scores might not be from me.

## Why mod Star Fox Assault?
I was board on late February 2022 and decided to replay Star Fox Assault with the goal of getting all the gold medals again. I thought this would take like a few weeks because of my struggle as a kid, but it took like 5 days instead. Most of which was dying on mission 10 over and over again. The gold medals were really easy in comparison. As a compromize I then optimized my scores to see what I could do and decided to put the game down when I was satisfied with what I had. After thinking that the April Fools prank I wanted to do, which involves changing RAM values, would take too long given the time (Maybe I'll do it down the line), I decided to instead look at the RAM of Star Fox Assault as a way to have more fun with the game. <br />
I did this expecting about a few more days of entertainment by giving myself infinite lives or something, but on my first big discovery on March 14th, 2022, I learned there was way more to it than basic number changing. I continued to do it more expecting maybe a few more days of fun, but days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months of me doing it semi-frequently. I ended up learning a lot about what's in RAM and how it's stored. Such as signed and unsigned variables, big and little endian, pointers, variable alignment, how floating point numbers are represented in hex, and generally how Object-Oriented-Programming looks. I also learned more about Gecko Codes when I deciced to make some of them and realized just how powerful they are.

## Why spend the time documenting what you found?
The Star Fox Franchise is niche, so any information on how the game works could spark some excitment for fans. I also found some (very little) cut content that would also be cool to show off. Also I have quite a lot of free time.

<a name="Num4">

## Should I DM you about x?
As long as your mature, asking something appropriate, and will treat me like a person, go nuts. Keep in mind I won't be online often so expect responces after a couple of days.

<a name="Num5">

## Why do you have an "x" account?

* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjyil8Of_mwMQs46utIAmBw): For having my documentation as easily accessible and understandable as possible
* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/modsault): Potentially speaking with other streamers
* [Github](https://github.com/ModSault): Well for this right here, and later down the line I would like to document memory address values as an interactive website instead of just a spreadsheet
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ModSault): To announce my findings on r/starfox and possible contact someone
* Discord (ModSault#1203): To be easily contacted by anyone

## How Often will you post/be online? 

For posting it'll happen whenever I'm done. This can take months without school and way longer when school is in session. So be patient. <br />
As for being online my discord account, whenever I feel like it.
